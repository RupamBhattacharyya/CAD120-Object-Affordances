Following procedure need to be followed to run Test.java successfully. I would like to advise the readers to go through the MLN folder's content (ReadMe.txt) before diving into the “Result” folder. 

The directory structure in Eclipse project should be the following:
   TestApproach (Java project name)
    -src
    -Input (files required for input)
    -Output (files produced after successful execution)

Input:-------

A1. A file will be generated after running MLN. Let us say the name of the file is "moving.result". Place this file alongside with the "src" folder (see above structure). You may need to change the line number 35 of Test.java according to your environment (Java project / Windows).


Output:-------

B2. Three files will generated namely; FormatedResult.txt, ViewResult.txt, MaxResult1.txt. The last file contains the actual result i.e. semantic object affordances. I have fixed the location of these file in the line numbers 19, 20, 21 of Test.java file respectively. You may need to change it according to your environment(Java project / Windows).

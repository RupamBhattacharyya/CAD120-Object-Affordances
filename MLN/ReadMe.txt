This folder contains;
a. rule file (affordancerules.mln) used for weight learning and inference.  
b. command.txt (commands to be typed in terminal)

This folder acts as an intermediary. It needs to be properly executed to get the results shown in our manuscript. Please read the following instructions carefully:

1. Please install Alchemy 1.0 from the link http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/alchemy1.html. 
2. We have already told that output obtained from "Modules" contain two folders where several test / train files are present. To successfully run the commands given in command.txt file all such files (train / test) needs to be placed inside the alchemy/bin/ folder. 
3. After successfully running the two commands; a file entitled as "closing.result" will be generated in the same "alchemy/bin" folder. This file will act as the input to the "Result" folder.
